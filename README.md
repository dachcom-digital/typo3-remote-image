typo3-remote-image
==================

This is a TYPO3 ViewHelper which allows you to insert a remote image with all the possibilities of the normal image ViewHelper.

Things to consider
-----------------

This ViewHelper doesn't take care of the temporary files. You have to take care of them for yourself.
